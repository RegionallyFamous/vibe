A Gutenberg block for personality-style quizzes. Generate quizzes with **Anthropic Claude** (API key in settings), **Save image** for a server-rendered share JPEG, and Open Graph / Twitter meta for shared result URLs.

== Description ==

* **Structured authoring** — Define **three outcomes** on the block (ids, titles, descriptions, **result images** from the Media Library), then **Generate questions from outcomes** so Claude only writes questions and scoring—your result copy stays yours. Edit questions and answers on the **canvas** before publishing.
* **Claude generation** — In the sidebar, pick a mode: **questions from my outcomes** (recommended), **full quiz**, **questions only**, or **results only**. Optional **style presets** (personality, this-or-that, fandom). Your API key stays on the server.
* **Result screen & links** — Per outcome, optional **link URL** and **button label**; optional **auto-redirect** after a short countdown (with “Go now” and **Cancel**). Visitors can still share or save the result card first.
* **Share & save** — One-tap links for **X, Facebook, and Reddit**, plus **Save image** (same server-rendered JPEG as Open Graph previews). Share copy invites friends to take the quiz; filters let you tune invitation lines and hashtags.
* **Link previews** — `?quiz_result=` adds `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and Twitter tags for social crawlers. **Settings → Default share image** sets `og:image` for the quiz page URL before someone takes the quiz (no query string).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `vibe-check` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install the zip from Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
2. Activate **Vibe Check** through the **Plugins** menu.
3. Run `npm install && npm run build` in the plugin directory if you use the source repository (the `build/` folder must exist).
4. **Settings → Vibe Check** — paste your [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (or define `VIBE_CHECK_CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `wp-config.php`). Optionally choose a **Default share image** so link previews show a branded image when the quiz page is shared before anyone selects a result.
5. Add the **Vibe Check** block and use **Generate** in the sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I put my API key? =

**Settings → Vibe Check** in WordPress admin, or add this to `wp-config.php` (above “That’s all”):

`define( 'VIBE_CHECK_CLAUDE_API_KEY', 'sk-ant-api03-...' );`

Never commit keys to git. The key is only used in PHP; never sent to site visitors.

= Does this work without Node / npm? =

You need the compiled assets in `build/` (from `npm run build`). Ship a release zip that already includes `build/`.

= Where are Open Graph images served? =

`GET /wp-json/vibe-check/v1/og-image?post_id=…&result_id=…` returns a JPEG. When `?quiz_result=` is present on a singular post, meta tags include title, description, and image for crawlers.

**Default share image** (under **Settings → Vibe Check**) is used for the **same post URL without** `?quiz_result=` so Facebook, X, and others show a preview image when someone shares the quiz before taking it. After a result is shared, the generated result card image is used instead.

= Privacy and data =

* **Claude** — Prompts are sent from WordPress to Anthropic’s API **only on the server** when an editor uses “Generate”. Visitors never receive your API key.
* **Share images** — **Save image** downloads a JPEG from your site’s **Open Graph image** REST endpoint (generated on the server). Images are not uploaded to a third-party host by this plugin.
* **Last result (optional)** — The front end may store the last quiz result title in **sessionStorage** so the intro can show “Last time: …”. It is not sent to the server.

= My result images look broken in the share preview =

If outcome images are hosted on another domain (CDN, separate media domain), the server may be unable to load them for the OG card unless files are readable from your WordPress host. Prefer storing images in the **Media Library** on the same installation, or ensure offloaded media remains accessible to PHP/GD.

= Rate limits =

* **Quiz generation** — Up to **20 successful** Anthropic API responses per WordPress user per rolling hour (transient-based). Failed network/API calls do not count; validation errors before calling Claude do not count.
* **OG image endpoint** — Up to **90** JPEG requests per IP per minute (abuse protection). Successful responses are cached in a transient (see below). Behind a reverse proxy, you can opt into reading the client IP from `CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` only if you enable the `vibe_check_trust_proxy_headers` filter (default: off, to avoid spoofing on misconfigured hosts).

= Developer filters (OG cache, rate limit IP) =

* **`vibe_check_og_jpeg_cache_ttl`** — (int) Seconds to store generated OG JPEG bytes in a transient. Default `DAY_IN_SECONDS`. Return `0` to disable caching.
* **`vibe_check_og_jpeg_cache_max_bytes`** — (int) Maximum JPEG size to cache (default 900000). Larger responses are not stored.
* **`vibe_check_trust_proxy_headers`** — (bool) When `true`, the OG rate limiter uses `HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP` or the first hop of `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` if valid; otherwise `REMOTE_ADDR`. Default `false`.

Cache keys include post ID, a hash of post content, `result_id`, and a generation counter bumped on `save_post` for posts that contain the quiz block, so edits invalidate cached images.

= Sharing & social =

* **Result row** — Native `<a href>` links (no JavaScript required) open **X**, **Facebook**, and **Reddit** intents with copy that includes your result plus an invitation to take the quiz. **Save image** downloads the same JPEG used for Open Graph previews when the block is on a published post (`post_id` &gt; 0). Optional **hashtags** from `vibe_check_share_hashtags` are folded into the X post text (when they fit) and the Reddit title.
* **Instagram / TikTok** — There is no universal “post this URL” API; visitors can **Save image**, open the app, and paste the quiz link from the address bar (or use a link sticker / bio link as the platform allows).
* **Link previews** — Shared URLs with `?quiz_result=` include `og:image` (quiz JPEG), title, and description. A short **“Take the quiz…”** line is appended to the description for scroll-stopping snippets (filterable). The **default share image** from Settings applies to the plain quiz page URL (see FAQ).

**Filters**

* **`vibe_check_share_strings`** — (array) Override `invitationShort`, `invitationLong`, and/or `hashtags` passed to the front-end script (default strings are translated in PHP).
* **`vibe_check_share_hashtags`** — (string) Optional hashtag line appended to the long share caption (runs before `vibe_check_share_strings` merges `hashtags`).
* **`vibe_check_og_result_description`** — (string) Final Open Graph / Twitter description for valid `?quiz_result=` URLs, after the plugin appends its CTA. Args: `$og_desc`, `$post_id`, `$result_id`, `$ctx`.
* **`vibe_check_default_share_image_attachment_id`** — (int) Attachment ID from Settings (or override). Return `0` to skip default `og:image` tags.
* **`vibe_check_default_share_image_url`** — (string) Image URL for default share preview. Args: `$url`, `$attachment_id`, `$post_id` (context; `0` if not singular).

= Is the API key encrypted in the database? =

Keys saved under **Settings → Vibe Check** are stored as a normal WordPress option (not encrypted). For production, prefer defining `VIBE_CHECK_CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `wp-config.php` so the key is not in the database.

== Changelog ==
